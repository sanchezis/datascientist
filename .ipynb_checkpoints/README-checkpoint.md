## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses Python 3, along with Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are necessary for running the notebook:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* MatplotLib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in exploring the AirBnB dataset from Seattle to better understand the following questions:
1. Do the prices vary by location?
2. Do the prices vary from older to newer hosts?
3. Can we predict the price using a model?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main code for this project is included in the notebook `science_blog.ipynb`. The notebook walks through all the steps of the CRISP-DM Process for analyzing the dataset to answer the above three questions. The code and results are also posted on Medium as a [blog post](https://medium.com/@issanllo/introduction-to-machine-learning-using-python-the-practical-way-a2c338ac2378).

Data for the project is not included because of large file sizes. To properly run the notebook, it must be placed in `data`. The directory should have the following files:
* `calendar.csv`
* `listings.csv`
* `reviews.csv`
* `neighbours.csv`
* `neighbours.geojson`

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@issanllo/introduction-to-machine-learning-using-python-the-practical-way-a2c338ac2378).
